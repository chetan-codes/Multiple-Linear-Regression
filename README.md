# Multiple Linear Regression

## Overview
Welcome to the Multiple Linear Regression repository! This project focuses on implementing multiple linear regression, a statistical technique used to analyze the relationship between multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable.

## Introduction
Multiple linear regression is a powerful tool for predictive modeling and is widely used in various fields such as economics, finance, and social sciences. In this repository, you'll find the implementation of multiple linear regression using Python.

## Contents
- `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for implementing a basic multiple linear regression model.
- `50_startups.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset of 50 startups used for regression analysis.

## Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Exploring the dataset to understand the relationships between variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for regression analysis.
3. **Model Building**: Implementing multiple linear regression using Python libraries like NumPy and scikit-learn.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the regression model using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Visualization**: Visualizing the results using plots and graphs to interpret the regression analysis.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the `multiple_linear_regression.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.

## Results
The multiple linear regression model achieved an R-squared value of X% on the test set, indicating the percentage of variance in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables.
